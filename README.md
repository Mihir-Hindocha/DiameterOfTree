# DiameterOfTree
This is Short Project 12 of Implementation of Data Structures class. Question:- Implement the algorithm to find the diameter of a tree using the algorithm discussed in class, that runs BFS twice. Code this algorithm without modifying Graph.java and BFSOO.java, using them from package rbk. Assume that the graph is acyclic and connected graph (tree).
